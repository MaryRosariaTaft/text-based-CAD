#CAD

Improvements to be made:
<ul>
<li>Accept negative length values (but not negative coordinates)</li>
<li>If a typo or mistake is made while writing input, prevent previous--intended--input from being erased (don't send the user back to the beginning of the method)</li>
<li>Maybe even convert all input to a GUI</li>
<li>Add 'bottom,' 'back,' and 'left' orientations (inverses of 'top,' 'front,' and 'side')</li>
<li>Write selective erase methods (using the shape-building methods to insert 'void' characters instead of 'filled' characters) rather than just one 'clearAllLayers' method</li>
<li>Allow user to choose the angles of a triangle</li>
<li>Allow user to choose the height (and thus the taper angle) of the pyramidal shapes</li>
<li>Write methods to draw shape *outlines* (or frames, for 3D shapes), not just solid objects</li>
<li>Choose and implement keyword which will allow the user to exit the program at any point (i.e. 'quit' or 'exit')</li>
</ul>
